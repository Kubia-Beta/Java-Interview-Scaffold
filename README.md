# Java Interview Scaffold
 A scaffold for a car rental service application in Java. There is one [unsegmented file](UnsegmentedScaffoldForInterview.java) for ease of viewing the entire program, and [another version](src/main) which is segmented into its classes as normal. Please remember that scaffolds are always a temporary structure. This is a demonstration of how I think about problems, not a finished program.
